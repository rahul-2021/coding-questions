https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/arrays/1-d/practice-problems/algorithm/pairs-having-similar-element-eed098aa/
in this code 1st we take input from user and check that if the difference betwwen 2 no is is equal to 1 or not if yes then we increase the counter if not then we see if the no is the 1st element or no if yes we add the total no with counter and after the loop is completely executed we print the total count.
